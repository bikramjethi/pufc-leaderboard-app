I have extracted out our match summaries from the year 2025 from our whatsapp chats. 
I want you to go through these match summaries and update the outdated data and object 
structure in @src/data/attendance-data/2025.json as per the same conventions as
@src/data/attendance-data/2026.json . 
Please note that match summaries might not have the complete data like all 
attendance name, but I want you to extract what is possible like team name colors, 
scorelines, totalGoals scored per game, and correctly tagging the games as weekday and weekends. 
For any new player you encounter who is not part of our @src/data/player-profiles.json 
add them with the groupAvailibility: "ONLOAN" and position "N/A" for now. 
The idea is while this data may not be complete enough for our attendance tracker, 
which we will skip implementing for 2025 we can use this data to plot our trends 
chart for 2025 and atleast enable that view for the previous year. 
Also as and when you encounter ownGoals please update them accordingly 
in @src/data/attendance-data/2025.json Once 2025.json is correctly 
updated we can update the leaderboard stats - @src/data/leaderboard-data/2025.json 
with the new ownGoal stat and enable own goal column on 2025 leaderboard as well.
